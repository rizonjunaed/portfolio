  summary: 'We use passwords everyday. Here, I will give important tips for managing passwords.',
  content: "<p>Md Junaed Hossain </p> <p>Date- 23 June,2021 </p> <p>It's difficult to go a few days without hearing about a massive data breach that might expose millions of consumers' sensitive information to hackers. </p> <p>Here are some suggestions for keeping personal information out of the wrong hands. </p> <p>1. Creating strong passwords </p> <p>One should not use words on number such as birthday, when creating a password. Changing the lower- and upper-case letters, numerals, and symbols is a good idea. It's also good to generate a unique password rather than using the same one on several sites—a password manager application can help to keep track of them. </p> <p>2. Not to overshare on social media </p> <p>We all have that one friend who posts too many intimate details of their life online. Not only can this be annoying, but it can also put personal information at risk. We should check privacy settings so we are aware of who’s seeing our posts, and be cautious when posting your location, hometown, birthday, or other personal details. </p> <p>3. Using free Wi-Fi with caution </p> <p>A little online shopping never hurt anyone…or did it? Most free public Wi-Fi networks have very few security measures in place, which means others using the same network could easily access our activity. We should wait until we are at home or on a secure, password-protected network before whipping out that credit card. </p> <p>4. Watching out for links and attachments </p> <p>Cybercriminals are sneaky, and will often compose their phishing scams to look like legitimate communications from a bank, utility company, or other corporate entity. Certain things like spelling errors or a different email address than the typical sender can be a clue that the email is spam. </p> <p>5. Checking to see if the site is secure </p> <p>Before entering personal information into a website, we should take a look at the top of our browser. If there is a lock symbol and the URL begins with “https,” that means the site is secure. There are a few other ways to determine if the site is trustworthy, such as a website privacy policy, contact information, or a “verified secure” seal. </p> <p>6. Considering additional protection </p> <p>Installing anti-virus software, anti-spyware software, and a firewall. For additional protection, it’s good to consider cyber insuPasswordrance, which can keep our family safe if we fall victim to a cyberattack. </p> <p>Reference: </p> <p>1.
