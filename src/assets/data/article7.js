  content: '<p>Md Junaed Hossain </p> <p>Date: June 25, 2021 </p> <p>In this rapidly evolving world, computers have become a part of our life. The very first computer was almost the size of a big room but less powerful than the smartphones we are using today. </p> <p>Here, I will share my tips on how to select a computer to buy. </p> <p>1. Determining the Purpose: </p> <p>Will the new computer be used for school? Work? Will it be a computer for the family to share? These are the questions we need to think through first, before deciding on which computer to purchase. For example, if someone wants a laptop so that they can watch cooking videos and read knitting blogs, then they won’t need a computer with an intense processing system. However, if someone is wanting a computer that will hold all of their school papers while still allowing them to download their favorite games, then they’ll need a computer that has more storage and a faster processor. </p> <p>2. Deciding Whether One Want a Desktop or a Laptop: </p> <p>After it is decided what the computer will be used for, then it can be decided whether to buy a desktop or a laptop computer. Most desktop computers and laptops have the same capabilities, so the real decision here lies in whether one needs the computer to be mobile or if it is going to be kept in one place. If purchasing a family computer, one may want to get a desktop so that young kids can’t sneak the laptop into their room. If getting a laptop for school, then one may want to get a laptop so that it can be taken to the school. </p> <p>3. Choose an Operating System: </p> <p>An operating system is just a fancy way of saying which software supports a computer’s basic functions. Mac and PC are both examples of operating systems. The choice here really comes down to personal preference. It’s always a good idea to choose a system with which one is familiar or that is compatible with their mobile device. </p> <p>4. Consider the Features: </p> <p>The final and important step in choosing the right computer is considering the features that are most important such as slim design, super-fast processing, or a bright display. </p> <p>These are my tips to use when determining which computer to buy. </p> <p>Reference: </p> <p>1.Building vs. Buying a PC: Which Is Right For You?
