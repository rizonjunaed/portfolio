  content: '<p>Md Junaed Hossain </p> <p>Date: June 13, 2021 </p> <p>I did a recipe website for my 1st assignment of HTML & CSS. Although it looks simple, it has big importance as it could be used by various people who are looking for a recipe for delicious food. Here I will explain some of the codes I used. </p> <p>Linking pages:  Here I linked 4 pages with &#60;li&#62;  tag. </p> <p>There will be an image. </p> <p>By linking the 4 pages of Breakfast, Lunch, Supper and Dessert, the user could easily switch to whichever menu they want. </p> <p>Adding Image and Menu name: </p> <p> There will be an image </p> <p>Here I used &#60;section&#62; tag to insert an image in the web page with &#60;img&#62; tag. After inserting the image, I gave a header by using &#60;h1&#62; tag. This tag is used to give headings. After that, I gave a small introduction of whatâ€™s the menu about and how many people it would serve. </p> <p>Giving instructions to make the menu item: </p> <p>There will be an image </p> <p>Here, I wanted to give the main recipe for making the dish. For that, I had to use &#60;ol&#62; tag (The &#60;ol&#62; tag makes an ordered list) and &#60;li&#62; tag (The &#60;li&#62; tag makes a list) so that, my given instructions are in an order.  </p> <p>This is how I used HTML to build the webpage. </p> <p>Diagram: </p> <p> There will be a diagram</p> <p>Fig: A diagram of HTML and CSS blocks for a webpage </p> <p>The above diagram means that, first the HTML must be written. After finishing that, the CSS code has to be written for styling the website.  </p> <p>CSS snippet:  </p> <p>There will be an image </p> <p>Here I am giving an example of how to get good visualization for the webpage using CSS. Here, I tagged heading and &#60;h1&#62; tag components to give them white color, made the text aligned to the center and set the background as dodgerblue color. So, using CSS, I get my text aligned and also colored. </p> <p>Diagram for CSS Syntax: </p> <p>There will be a digram </p> <p>Fig: A diagram to explain a simple CSS syntax. </p> <p> </p> <p>Here, &#60;h1&#62; represents as a selector. It means it is selecting all the &#60;h1&#62; tag to give a style. To give a styling, the property I used to style with is color and gave the color property a value as blue. The place where I am giving the property and value is called a declaration block. </p> <p>Reference: </p> <p>1. https://www.w3schools.com/html/ </p> <p>2. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML </p>',
