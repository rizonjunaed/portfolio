  summary: 'SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. I will try to give a good explanation about SSL here.',
  content: "<p>Md Junaed Hossain </p> <p>Date: May 16,2021 </p> <p>In 1994 Netscape started improving SSL1.0 which drove the advancement of HTTPS based on SSL 2.0 and its successor TLS. SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer which is a standard innovation for keeping online activity secure and safeguarding any private information that's being sent between two users. This prevents offenders from seeing and adjusting any data exchanged. </p> <p>TLS/SSL: </p> <p>TLS stands for Transport Layer Security which was released in 1999 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The distinction between SSL and TLS isn't noteworthy since the final adaptation of SSL and the primary form of TLS are nearly the same. One of the reasons for the title change is because the administration was changed. </p> <p>Encryption: </p> <p>SSL mainly works by encrypting messages. Encryption is a way of scrambling information so that only the authorized parties can get  the data. In easier terms, encryption takes readable information and changes it so that it requires the use of a cryptographic key: a set of mathematical values that both the sender and the receiver of a scrambled message agree on. Thus, encrypting helps to pass messages from one party to another without the fear of somebody else taking the information. </p> <p>HTTP VS HTTPS: </p> <p>We probably do not pay much attention to the full address of a website, after all, we are used to typing a name directly into the address bar and leaving the rest in our browser. But that was not always the case. Once, we had to write the full URL in the address bar to get to the site we wanted. So if the browser was asked to show the full address in the url bar, we will find that some sites have the 'http' prefix. While others - especially if we are doing a transaction, we will see the 'https' prefix. What is the - extremely important difference - between the two? Actually, these prefixes are related to technology protocols that make it possible to navigate through various websites, hyperlinks and web pages on the Internet. So HTTP means Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, and is the primary technology that enables hyperlinks and browsing in general - in short, without this, there is no Web navigation. This protocol emerged from the need to secure transactions through the Web. SSL is a powerful, secure and impenetrable encryption system that makes our data inaccessible to intruders when transmitted over the Internet. We know that a site is safe if we look at the beginning of its address in the URL bar and 'https' is there. Whenever we go shopping in an online store, and we need to enter in addition to our personal data and credit card details, it is advisable to check first that the https prefix is at the beginning of the address bar. Below is an illustration of the difference between the security of http and https. </p> <img src='/publicAssets/image/ssl.jpg' alt ='Http and https' width = '620' height = '290' />  <p> Fig: HTTP vs  HTTPS ( Source : https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/ ) </p> <p>SSL certificate: </p> <p>Certificates are small data files that are digitally linked to an encrypted key with the details of an organization. Therefore, enable the Padlock and https protocols that allow secure connections from a web server to a web browser. SSL is mostly used for credit card transactions, user logins, social media sites, etc. which we want to be secured. </p> <p>To conclude, in this technologically advanced world, we use our personal information on various social platforms, as well as to buy or sell on various websites. And to keep our personal data confidential, it is important to use SSL if we are to keep our information private and not let our data be read by anyone else. Therefore, the importance of SSL is significant. </p>",
